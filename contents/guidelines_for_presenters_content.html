  <p>First of all, we welcome all of you to TSWIM 2017. Thank you for presenting your studies in the workshop. To make sure that all sessions run smoothly, we provide the following brief guidelines for all authors to follow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Please arrive at the meeting room of your presentation session 5 minutes before the beginning of the session.</p></li>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Please upload your Powerpoint file onto the computer for presentation and make sure that your file runs appropriately.</p></li>
      <li><p>Please introduce yourself to your session chair so that the session chair will know who will present the paper.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li><p>Each presentation session is allocated 1 hours and 45 minutes for three paper presentations. Please prepare and <strong>finish your presentation in 15 minutes</strong>. 20 minutes are reserved for comments/suggestions by advisors and open floor discussions (Q&amp;A).</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is extremely important for presenters to follow the guidelines.</p>
