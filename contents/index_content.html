<p class="text-justify">The Fifth Taiwan Summer Workshop on Information Management (TSWIM 2017) will be held in Tainan, Taiwan on June 26-28, 2017. It will be organized and hosted by Institute of International Management, National Cheng Kung University. TSWIM promotes research collaboration between Information Systems (IS) scholars and PhD students in Taiwan and other countries. The main purpose of TSWIM is to provide a forum for discussion and interaction among Taiwanese and international scholars with research interests in the cutting edge issues of information systems and management on individuals, businesses, organizations, and societies.</p>
<p class="text-justify">We welcome submissions of original research papers addressing issues concerning the theory, design, development, evaluation, and application of information technologies and management. High-quality papers will be invited to journals for fast-track publication. Since it is a research workshop, TSWIM also actively solicits innovative and thought-provoking papers describing novel research ideas that may be at a relatively early stage of development (research-in-progress submissions) to improve its future publication possibility. We encourage IS PhD students to submit their thesis-in-progress work to TSWIM. International IS scholars will be invited as discussants to provide comments for paper presentations.</p>
