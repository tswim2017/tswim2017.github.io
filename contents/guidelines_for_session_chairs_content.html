<h3 class="title">Guidelines for Session Chairs</h3>
<div class="text-justify">
  <p>First of all, we sincerely welcome all of you to TSWIM 2017. Thank you very much for serving as session chairs. Brief guidelines for session chairs are listed below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Please arrive at the meeting room of your session 5 minutes before the start of the session.</p></li>
    <li><p>Please try to identify all presenters before your session starts.</p></li>
    <li><p>Each presentation session is allocated 1 hour and 45 minutes for three or four paper presentations. We ask each presenter to <strong>finish his/her presentation in 15 minutes and leave 20 minutes for comments/suggestions</strong> by advisors and open floor discussions (Q&amp;A). Please follow this time guideline strictly.</p></li>
    <li><p>When you are ready to start the session, please introduce the session and explain how it will be conducted. For each paper presentation, please first introduce the presenter and the title of the paper, manage the time for the presenter, and facilitate the discussions between advisors and the presenter.</p></li>
    <li><p>Please finish your session on time.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thank you very much for your assistance.</p>
